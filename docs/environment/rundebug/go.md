# Running & Debugging (Go)

To run the server, go to the root of your project and run

```bash
    go run main.go
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to check the app.


Debugging Go code can vary in difficulty, depending what IDE you are using, if using any IDE at all. 
Instead of rewriting here the debugging tutorials, check one of these tutorials, corresponding to your taste.

- For hardcore, terminal only debugging, there is the [way of GDB](https://golang.org/doc/gdb)

- For Visual Studio Code, there is simple setup explained [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Debugging-Go-code-using-VS-Code)

- For those that don't like setup anything, there is [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) that includes all needed visual tools and should be familiar to those using JetBrains products.
