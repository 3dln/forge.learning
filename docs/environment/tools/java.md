# Tools (JAVA)

Install [JAVA SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to run your code. 

Install [TOMCAT](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) to launch the server. 

Now we need an IDE to write the code. Since we need an web application of JAVA,this tutorial will use [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE (not-free). There are some other choices which are free, but would need seperate plugins or enablers.

> For this tutorial, use all default install options.

Next: [setup](environment/setup/)
