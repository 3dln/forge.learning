# Tools (JAVA)

Install [JAVA SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) to run your code. 

Install [TOMCAT](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) to launch the server. 

> A good tutorial on how to setup your Tomcat server can be found [here](https://crunchify.com/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-and-install-apache-tomcat-server-in-eclipse-development-environment-ide/)

Now we need an IDE to write the code. Since we need an web application of JAVA,this tutorial will use [Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/oxygen3). 

> For this tutorial, use all default install options.
