# Create a new project

Go to menu File >> New >> New Project and select Web >> Web API.

Install the Autodesk Forge NuGet package: go to Tools >> Manage NuGet packages, search for *Autodesk Forge* and install it. If you prefer, via command line, use:

```
PM> Install-Package Autodesk.Forge
```

At this point, the webapp is not doing anything, but you can always test it with menu **Debug >> Run**.
